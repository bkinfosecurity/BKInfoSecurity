## Introduction

The Cybersecurity Blog is a platform where I share my experiences, knowledge, and insights in the field of cybersecurity. Through this repository, I aim to provide practical examples, real-world scenarios, and step-by-step guides to help you learn and improve your cybersecurity skills.

## Projects

In the `Projects` directory, you will find various cybersecurity projects that cover a wide range of topics, such as network security, web application security, cryptography, malware analysis, and more. Each project comes with a detailed README file containing instructions, code samples, and explanations.

Feel free to explore the projects, experiment with the code, and adapt them to suit your needs. If you have any questions or suggestions regarding the projects, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Boot2Root Walkthroughs

The `Boot2Root Walkthroughs` directory contains step-by-step guides for boot2root challenges. These walkthroughs are designed to help you practice and improve your penetration testing and ethical hacking skills. Each walkthrough provides a target VM or environment, along with a detailed explanation of the techniques and tools used to exploit vulnerabilities and gain root access.

Please note that boot2root challenges are meant to be solved in a legal and ethical manner. Always ensure that you have permission to perform any security assessments or tests.
